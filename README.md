A short program that I made for my Advanced Java Programming class.
Its purpose is to take an HTML file as input and convert its content to pig latin without changing any of the HTML format and styling

The program needs 2 command line arguments to be executed: jav -jar Web_To_Piglatin inputFile outputFile

This website explains how pig latin works: https://reference.yourdictionary.com/resources/how-to-speak-pig-latin-basic-rules.html
